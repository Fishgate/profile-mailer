Small updates
- Add "Chrome frame" to rectify HTML5 elements rendering and better browsing for end user.
- Put user authentication on the script execute pages too and not just the front end interface ones

Medium updates
- impliment and test phpmailer in the error log system to notify us about errors
- Complete validation on #importconfigform
- Error handling on importconfig.php is terrible
- force errors on the file upload (import.exec.php) for testing
- server side validation for import list (if list name is already in use)
- error exception handling in the whole EditList class
- Need some kind of error checking in the imported CSV file incase it is empty or nothing was imported
- on importconfig.php the current column headers are assumed as temp_1, temp_2, etc, and just generated in a for loop. This needs to be actually fetched dynamicaly from the information schema for the propper manageing of lists
- Upon uploading a list, auto remove all role based and misformed email addresses
- proper error handling/validation on importconfig in terms of the user putting in column header which are not valid SQL syntax

Large updates
- Server side validation on all forms
- Do a massive clean up of the codebase in terms of error handling i.e. exceptions vs return codes
- find a more robust way of dealing with the validation and processing of forms. The Javascript file is getting painfully large.
