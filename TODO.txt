Small updates
- impliment phpmailer into the error log system to notify us about errors
- get rid of the neccecity for <p> tags in the template alerts of alerts.json
- Add "Chrome frame" to rectify HTML5 elements rendering and better browsing for end user.
- Add validation to list_acquired textarea on importlist.php
- Put user authentication on the script execute pages too and not just the front end interface ones
- Need a progress GIF on the importlist.php page when uploading a lit
- Put the end user strings from the import process into the alerts.json

Medium updates
- Error handling on importconfig.php is terrible
- force errors on the file upload (import.exec.php) for testing
- server side validation for import list (if list name is already in use)
- error exception handling in the whole EditList class
- Need some kind of error checking in the imported CSV file incase it is empty or nothing was imported
- on importconfig.php the current column headers are assumed as temp_1, temp_2, etc, and just generated in a for loop. This needs to be actually fetched dynamicaly from the information schema for the propper manageing of lists
- Upon uploading a list, auto remove all role based and misformed email addresses

Large updates
- Server side validation on all forms
- Do a massive clean up of the codebase in terms of error handling i.e. exceptions vs return codes
